## Regular Events

We host several regular events to keep our community engaged and connected:

### Mixer and Showcase
Held on the first Wednesday of each month, this event combines networking, learning, and showcasing:
- We start with a mixer that runs parallel to a 101 track to bring people up to speed.
- The main show follows, featuring showcases, labs, panels, and workshops.
- This is our primary monthly event where we come together to learn, share, and collaborate.

**Location**: Center for Government and Civil Service at ACC Rio Grande Campus (ACC RGC3000)
- Address: 1218 West Avenue, Austin, TX
- Directions: It's the tan brick building on your left if you are going north on West Avenue between 12th and 13th streets. Go up the stairs to reach ACC RGC3000.
- Parking: The parking garage is free, but please note that the metal doors shut and lock at 9 PM. If you plan to stay later for conversations after the event, we recommend parking your car for free on the street. Street parking is free after 6 PM.

### Mid-Month Happy Hours
Typically held two weeks after the Mixer and Showcase, on a Wednesday. These social gatherings are a great way to network and connect with other community members in a relaxed setting. Check our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/austin-langchain-ai-group/) for specific dates and locations.
