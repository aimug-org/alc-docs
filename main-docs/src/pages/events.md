# Events

Welcome to the Austin LangChain Events page!

Here you'll find information about upcoming meetups, workshops, and other events related to LangChain and AI in the Austin area.

## Regular Events

We host several regular events to keep our community engaged and connected:

### Mixer and Showcase
Held on the first Wednesday of each month, this event combines networking, learning, and showcasing:
- We start with a mixer that runs parallel to a 101 track to bring people up to speed.
- The main show follows, featuring showcases, labs, panels, and workshops.
- This is our primary monthly event where we come together to learn, share, and collaborate.

### Mid-Month Happy Hours
Typically held two weeks after the Mixer and Showcase, on a Wednesday. These social gatherings are a great way to network and connect with other community members in a relaxed setting. Check our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/austin-langchain-ai-group/) for specific dates and locations.

### Office Hours
Every Tuesday at 2 PM Central, join us in the [Discord Meeting Room](https://discord.com/channels/1149779360178524272/1149779360967045170) for Office Hours. This is a great opportunity to ask questions, get help with your projects, or just chat with other community members.
