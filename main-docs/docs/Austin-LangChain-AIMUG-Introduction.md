# Welcome to AI Middleware Users Group: Learning AI Together

## Learning in the Open

Welcome to the AI Middleware Users Group (Austin LangChain AIMUG), a community dedicated to exploring and understanding AI through the lens of LangChain and other AI middleware technologies! We believe in "Learning in the Open" - sharing our discoveries, challenges, and successes as we navigate the rapidly evolving world of AI together.

## What is AI Middleware?

AI middleware technologies like LangChain, LangGraph, and emerging frameworks serve as bridges that connect various AI technologies, making them accessible and practical. Think of them as Swiss Army knives for AI development, bringing together:

- Large Language Models (like GPT-4, Claude, and local models)
- Vector Databases
- Document Processing
- Memory Systems
- Agent Architectures
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- And much more!

Through these middleware integrations, we can explore the entire AI ecosystem while building practical applications. While we started with LangChain, our community now explores the full spectrum of AI middleware technologies.

## Our Learning Journey

Since October 2023, we've been documenting our collective learning journey through monthly meetings, hands-on labs, and community showcases. Each month brings new discoveries:

- **Starting Simple**: We began with basic chatbots and document search
- **Growing Together**: We progressed to advanced RAG systems and AI agents
- **Breaking New Ground**: Now we're exploring cutting-edge topics like LangGraph and edge computing

## Browse Our Journey

We encourage you to explore our monthly meeting folders chronologically. Each folder contains:
- Detailed lab notebooks
- Presentation recordings
- Code examples
- Community showcases

Start from our [October 2023](/docs/oct-2023) sessions and follow our progression through:
- RAG implementations
- Docker containerization
- LangGraph development
- GPU integration
- AI Data Science
- And beyond!
