# RAG Quickstart

In this section, we'll explore how to build a Question Answering (QA) application using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain. RAG is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of large language models with the ability to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base.

## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method that enhances the capabilities of language models by allowing them to access and use external knowledge. This is particularly useful for creating QA systems that can provide accurate and contextual answers based on specific documents or datasets.

In this guide, we'll build a RAG-based QA system using a transcript from a LangChain 101 virtual session as our knowledge base.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. An OpenAI API key
2. Installed the required libraries: `langchain`, `langchain-community`, `langchainhub`, `langchain-openai`, `chromadb`, and `bs4`
3. A text file containing the transcript (in this case, "langchain_101-Transcript.txt")

## Setting Up the Environment

First, let's set up our environment and import the necessary modules:

```python
import os
from langchain import hub
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings

# Set your OpenAI API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"
```

## Building the RAG Pipeline

Now, let's build our RAG pipeline step by step:

### 1. Load and Split the Document

```python
# Load the document
loader = TextLoader("path/to/langchain_101-Transcript.txt")
docs = loader.load()

# Split the document into smaller chunks
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)
```

### 2. Create a Vector Store

```python
# Create a vector store from the document chunks
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
```

### 3. Set Up the Language Model and Prompt

```python
# Get the RAG prompt from the LangChain hub
prompt = hub.pull("rlm/rag-prompt")

# Initialize the language model
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)
```

### 4. Define the RAG Chain

```python
# Function to format retrieved documents
def format_docs(docs):
    return "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)

# Define the RAG chain
rag_chain = (
    {"context": retriever | format_docs, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)
```

## Using the RAG Chain

Now that we have our RAG chain set up, we can use it to answer questions:

```python
# Ask a question
question = "What did Ricky say about caching in Streamlit?"
answer = rag_chain.invoke(question)
print(answer)
```

This will retrieve relevant information from the transcript and generate an answer based on the context and the question.

## Best Practices

1. **Document Splitting**: Experiment with different chunk sizes and overlaps to find the optimal balance for your specific use case.
2. **Retriever Configuration**: Adjust the retriever settings (e.g., number of documents to retrieve) to improve relevance and performance.
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Refine the RAG prompt to guide the model in generating more accurate and helpful responses.
4. **Model Selection**: Try different language models to find the best balance between performance and cost for your application.

## Conclusion

Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a powerful technique that can significantly enhance the capabilities of your QA systems. By combining the strengths of large language models with the ability to retrieve relevant information from a specific knowledge base, you can create more accurate and contextually aware applications.
