# Introduction to Streamlit

## Presenter
**Colin McNamara** is the core maintainer and founder of Austin LangChain AIMUG, currently at Always Cool Brands in Austin, TX. His work in creating the initial Streamlit integration labs has helped establish a foundation for building interactive AI applications within the community.

> "Our focus is really low-stress learning and sharing. We're not trying to be experts. We're all learning. This is a fast-moving project. We are here to connect with other early adopters of AI middleware, and specifically, focused around the Lankchain project."
