# Streamlit Document Search with LangChain

This document provides an overview of the Streamlit document search functionality using LangChain, as demonstrated in the `101-2-streamlit_document_search.ipynb` notebook.

## Overview

The Streamlit document search notebook demonstrates how to create a web application that allows users to search through a collection of documents using natural language queries. This application leverages LangChain's document loading, text splitting, and retrieval capabilities, combined with Streamlit's interactive interface.

## Key Concepts

- Loading and processing documents with LangChain
- Creating and using vector stores for efficient document retrieval
- Implementing similarity search using embeddings
- Building an interactive search interface with Streamlit

## Notebook Contents

The notebook covers the following main topics:

1. Setting up the necessary imports and configurations
2. Loading and processing documents
3. Creating a vector store from the processed documents
4. Implementing a search function using LangChain's retrieval capabilities
5. Building a Streamlit interface for user queries and result display

## How to Use

To explore this notebook and run the Streamlit document search application:

1. Open the [101-2-streamlit_document_search.ipynb](https://github.com/aimug-org/austin_langchain/blob/main/labs/LangChain_101/101-2-streamlit_document_search.ipynb) notebook in the GitHub repository.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to set up your environment and prepare the document collection.
3. Run the Streamlit application and use the interface to perform document searches.

## Learning Outcomes

By studying this notebook, you will learn:

- How to load and process documents using LangChain
- Techniques for creating and using vector stores for efficient document retrieval
- Methods for implementing similarity search using embeddings
- Best practices for building interactive search interfaces with Streamlit
