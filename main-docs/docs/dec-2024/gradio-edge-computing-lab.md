# Edge Computing with Gradio and Cloudflare Lab

Welcome to our hands-on lab session on Edge Computing using Gradio and Cloudflare! This lab will guide you through building and deploying efficient AI applications at the edge.

## Lab Materials

All materials for this lab can be found in our [LangChain_111 GitHub repository](https://github.com/aimug-org/austin_langchain/tree/main/labs/LangChain_111). The lab includes:

1. [CloudflareSetup.md](https://github.com/aimug-org/austin_langchain/blob/main/labs/LangChain_111/CloudflareSetup.md) - Instructions for setting up Cloudflare for edge deployment
2. [Intro_to_Gradio.ipynb](https://github.com/aimug-org/austin_langchain/blob/main/labs/LangChain_111/Intro_to_Gradio.ipynb) - Introduction to building interfaces with Gradio
3. [Spoil_a_wish.ipynb](https://github.com/aimug-org/austin_langchain/blob/main/labs/LangChain_111/Spoil_a_wish.ipynb) - A fun example application demonstrating Gradio capabilities

## Prerequisites

Before starting the lab, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- A Cloudflare account (free tier is sufficient)
