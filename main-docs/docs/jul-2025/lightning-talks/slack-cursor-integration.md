## 🛠️ **Implementation Examples**

### **Basic Workflow**

**📱 Mobile Development Session**
```
You: "I need to add user authentication to my React app"

Cursor AI: I'll help you add authentication. Here's what I'll create:
1. Login component with form validation
2. Authentication context for state management  
3. Protected route wrapper
4. JWT token handling

Would you like me to start with the login component?

You: "Yes, make it mobile responsive"

Cursor AI: [Generates responsive login component code]
```

**⚡ Quick Bug Fixes**
```
You: "Production issue - users can't submit forms"

Cursor AI: Let me check your form components... 
Found the issue: missing CSRF token in the API calls.
Here's the fix: [Shows code diff]

Shall I deploy this fix to production?

You: "Deploy it"

Cursor AI: ✅ Fix deployed successfully. Issue resolved.
```

  const codeRequest = command.text;
  const aiResponse = await cursorAI.generateCode({
    prompt: codeRequest,
    context: await getProjectContext()
  });
  
  await respond({
    text: `Generated code for: ${codeRequest}`,
    blocks: formatCodeResponse(aiResponse)
  });
});
```
