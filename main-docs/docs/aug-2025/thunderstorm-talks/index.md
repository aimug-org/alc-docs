# Thunderstorm Talks - August 2025

Extended technical presentations with comprehensive deep dives into advanced agent architectures and development workflows.

## Featured Talks

### üèóÔ∏è Deep Agents Architecture
*Moving beyond simple tool loops*

**The Four Pillars of Sophisticated Agents**:

1. **Detailed System Prompts** - Establish patterns and consistency
2. **Planning Tools** - Even simple to-do lists improve structure
3. **Sub-agents** - Specialized delegation for complex tasks
4. **File Systems** - Persistent intermediate state management

**Integration with LangGraph**:
- Natural pairing with state persistence
- Subgraphs for sub-agent delegation
- Interrupts for operator control
- Long-running flow support

### üîß [A2A Implementation Guide](./a2a-implementation-guide.md)
*Production patterns for discovery, caching, and attribution*

Learn production-ready patterns for:
- Discovery architecture
- Gateway and routing design
- Cache optimization strategies
- Security and attribution
- Observability with OpenTelemetry

### üíª Claude AI Development Workflows
*Presented by Nate Little*

Advanced development patterns using Claude for:
- Code generation and review
- Architecture design
- Documentation automation
- Testing strategies
- Workflow optimization

## Key Takeaways
