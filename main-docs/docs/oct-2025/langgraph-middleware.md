# LangGraph 1.0 Alpha & Middleware

**Presenter**: Colin McNamara
**Date**: October 1, 2025
**Duration**: 15 minutes (Thunderstorm Talk)

## Overview

Colin McNamara presented an exploration of LangGraph 1.0 alpha features, with a focus on the new middleware functionality that enables sophisticated agent control and optimization patterns.

**Update**: The LangChain Middleware API is now officially released! Watch the official release video:

## Key Topics

### LangGraph 1.0 Transition
- Moving from beta to stable 1.0 releases
- Version: LangGraph 1.0 alpha 4
- LangChain 1.0 alpha 10 compatibility
- Breaking changes and migration considerations

### Middleware Architecture

LangGraph introduces three middleware hooks for controlling agent execution:

1. **before_model** - Pre-processing hook
2. **model** - Model invocation hook
3. **after_model** - Post-processing hook

### Before Model Hook

Capabilities:
- Update agent state dynamically
- Jump to different nodes in the graph
- Manage context (token limits, message history)
- Implement guardrails (Nemo Guardrails integration)
- Control what enters the model

Example use cases:
- Keeping only last 20 lines of context
- Token limit management
- Input validation and filtering

### Model Hook

Capabilities:
- Swap models on-the-fly based on query complexity
- Model routing (GPT-4o-mini vs o3 based on complexity)
- Dynamic prompt adjustment per model
- Tool scope management (security/safety)
- Output format control (JSON, structured outputs)
- Caching layer implementation

Cost optimization example:
- Estimated $5,100/month savings for 1000-user agent
- (Note: Numbers require production validation)

### After Model Hook

Capabilities:
- Output inspection and validation
- Circuit breakers (halt on unsafe/unexpected output)
- Human-in-the-loop integration
- Metrics collection (OpenTelemetry integration)
- Anomaly detection

### Human-in-the-Loop Pattern

```python
# Interrupt on specific tool calls
if tool == "delete_database":
    interrupt()  # Require human approval
```

Use cases:
- Email sending approval
- Database modifications
- High-value transactions
- Capacity-exceeding orders

## Real-World Use Case: FinOps Workflow

Colin shared his production use case for food manufacturing:

**Scenario**: EDI order processing with QuickBooks integration

**Requirements**:
- Automatic processing for normal-sized orders
- Human review for capacity-exceeding orders
- State persistence in PostgreSQL
- Rollback capabilities
- OpenTelemetry logging

**Why LangGraph**:
- State management with checkpointing
- Graph execution framework
- OpenTelemetry native support
- Human-in-the-loop hooks
- Rollback capabilities

## Technical Implementation

### Installation

```bash
pip install langgraph==1.0.0a4
pip install langchain==1.0.0a10
```

### Key Features

1. **Context Management**
   - Automatic message history truncation
   - Token-based limiting
   - Smart context windowing

2. **Caching Middleware**
   - Agent-level caching
   - Cost reduction
   - Performance improvement

3. **Dynamic Behaviors**
   - Runtime model selection
   - Adaptive prompt engineering
   - Tool availability control

4. **Composition**
   - Stack middleware functions
   - Chain multiple hooks
   - Modular architecture

## Gotchas & Limitations

⚠️ **Alpha Code Warnings**:
- Explicit tool definitions required
- Must define interrupts explicitly
- Cannot use generic configurations
- Specific summarization model calls needed
- Checkpointer must be explicitly defined

## Production Considerations

### When to Use LangGraph Middleware
- ✅ Complex agent workflows
- ✅ Human-in-the-loop requirements
- ✅ Cost optimization needs
- ✅ State management critical
- ✅ Observability requirements

### Alternative Solutions
- Native OpenAI for simple use cases
- Other orchestration frameworks
- Direct API calls for basic scenarios

## Comparison: JPMorgan Chase & NuvoBank

Major financial institutions using LangGraph:
- JPMorgan Chase
- NuvoBank
- LinkedIn
- Production-proven at scale

## Testing & Development

### Getting Started

1. Install alpha versions
2. Start with summarization middleware
3. Log everything
4. Test thoroughly
5. Share results with community

### Resources

- **Blog Post**: [colinmcnamara.com](https://colinmcnamara.com) - Study guide with detailed notes
- **Official Docs**: [langchain.com](https://langchain.com)
- **LangChain Slack**: Community support (though Colin prefers Discord)
- **AIMUG Discord**: [aimug.org/discord](https://aimug.org/discord)

## Deep Agents Integration

LangGraph Middleware is now integrated into Deep Agents (Quad Code clone):
- Agent-based coding assistance
- Middleware-powered optimizations
- Production-ready patterns

## Community Use Cases

From the discussion:

1. **Manufacturing/CPG**:
   - EDI order processing
   - QuickBooks integration
   - Inventory management
   - Capacity planning

2. **Software Development**:
   - Code generation workflows
   - Testing automation
   - Deployment pipelines

3. **Data Processing**:
   - PDF processing
   - RAG implementations
   - Batch operations

## Key Takeaways

1. **Middleware is Game-Changing**: Control agent behavior at three critical points
2. **Production-Ready Path**: 1.0 stable coming soon, plan migrations now
3. **Cost Optimization**: Caching and model routing can significantly reduce costs
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Essential for production agents handling critical operations
5. **Observability**: Native OpenTelemetry support for production monitoring

## Q&A Highlights

**Q**: Why LangGraph vs other tools?
**A**: State management, human-in-the-loop, observability, and production support from major companies

**Q**: What about alternative frameworks?
**A**: Use what works for you - Colin uses both LangGraph and native OpenAI depending on use case

**Q**: Production readiness?
**A**: Waiting for 1.0 stable, but alpha is usable for testing

## Code Examples

Examples and implementations available in:
- Austin LangChain repo
- AIMUG.org presentations
- Colin's blog

## Next Steps

1. Try the alpha versions in development
2. Test middleware patterns
3. Share findings in Discord
4. Contribute to community knowledge
5. Plan for 1.0 stable migration
