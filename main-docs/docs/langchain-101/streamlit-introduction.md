# Introduction to Streamlit with LangChain

This document provides an overview of using Streamlit with LangChain, as demonstrated in the `101-4-streamlit_introduction.ipynb` notebook.

## Overview

The Streamlit introduction notebook serves as a comprehensive guide to creating interactive web applications that leverage the power of LangChain. It demonstrates how to build user-friendly interfaces for various LangChain functionalities, making it easier for users to interact with language models and chain-based applications.

## Key Concepts

- Setting up a Streamlit application with LangChain
- Creating interactive UI elements for user input
- Implementing LangChain components within a Streamlit app
- Displaying LangChain outputs in a user-friendly manner

## Notebook Contents

The notebook covers the following main topics:

1. Introduction to Streamlit and its integration with LangChain
2. Setting up the development environment
3. Creating basic Streamlit UI elements (text inputs, buttons, etc.)
4. Implementing LangChain components (e.g., language models, chains) in Streamlit
5. Displaying LangChain outputs and results in the Streamlit interface
6. Best practices for building Streamlit apps with LangChain

## How to Use

To explore this notebook and create your own Streamlit applications with LangChain:

1. Open the [101-4-streamlit_introduction.ipynb](https://github.com/aimug-org/austin_langchain/blob/main/labs/LangChain_101/101-4-streamlit_introduction.ipynb) notebook in the GitHub repository.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions to set up your environment and create a Streamlit app.
3. Experiment with different UI elements and LangChain components.
4. Run the Streamlit application and interact with your created interface.
