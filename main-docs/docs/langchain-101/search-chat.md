# Search and Chat with LangChain

This document provides an overview of the search and chat functionality using LangChain, as demonstrated in the `101-3-search-chat.ipynb` notebook.

## Overview

The search and chat notebook showcases how to create a system that combines document search capabilities with a conversational interface. This powerful combination allows users to ask questions about specific documents and receive informed responses based on the document content.

## Key Concepts

- Implementing document search functionality
- Creating a conversational chain with memory
- Combining search results with language model responses
- Handling follow-up questions and maintaining context

## Notebook Contents

The notebook covers the following main topics:

1. Setting up the necessary imports and configurations
2. Implementing document loading and search functionality
3. Creating a conversational chain with memory
4. Combining search results with the language model's knowledge
5. Handling user queries and generating informed responses

## How to Use

To explore this notebook and experiment with the search and chat functionality:

1. Open the [101-3-search-chat.ipynb](https://github.com/aimug-org/austin_langchain/blob/main/labs/LangChain_101/101-3-search-chat.ipynb) notebook in the GitHub repository.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to set up your environment and prepare the document collection.
3. Run the cells to create the search and chat system.
4. Interact with the system by asking questions about the documents and observe how it handles follow-up queries.

## Learning Outcomes

By studying this notebook, you will learn:

- How to implement document search functionality using LangChain
- Techniques for creating a conversational chain with memory
- Methods for combining search results with language model responses
- Best practices for handling follow-up questions and maintaining context in a chat system
