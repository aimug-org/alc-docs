# LangServe Pirate Speak with LangChain

This document provides an overview of using LangServe to create a pirate speak translator, as demonstrated in the `LC_102-LangServe-pirate-speak.ipynb` notebook.

## Overview

The LangServe Pirate Speak notebook showcases how to build and deploy a fun and interactive language translation service using LangChain and LangServe. This application translates regular English text into pirate-speak, demonstrating the flexibility and power of LangChain for creating custom language processing applications.

## Key Concepts

- Setting up and using LangServe with LangChain
- Creating a custom language translation chain
- Deploying a LangChain application as a web service
- Interacting with the deployed service via API calls

## Notebook Contents

The notebook covers the following main topics:

1. Setting up the necessary imports and configurations for LangChain and LangServe
2. Creating a custom chain for translating English to pirate speak
3. Defining the input and output schemas for the translation service
4. Deploying the translation chain as a LangServe application
5. Testing the deployed service with sample API calls

## How to Use

To explore this notebook and create your own LangServe application:

1. Open the [LC_102-LangServe-pirate-speak.ipynb](https://github.com/aimug-org/austin_langchain/blob/main/labs/LangChain_102/LC_102-LangServe-pirate-speak.ipynb) notebook in the GitHub repository.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions to set up your environment and create the pirate speak translator.
3. Deploy the LangServe application locally or to a cloud service.
4. Use the provided API endpoints to interact with your pirate speak translator.
