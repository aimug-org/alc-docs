# AI Ecosystem 2025
## From Framework Wars to Universal Standards

# The Big Question Changed

<div class="big-text">❌ "What framework should I use?"</div>

<div class="big-text">✅ "What are you going to build?"</div>

---

# Framework Wars Are Over

## Why? Modern AI IDEs make the choice matter less.

- **LangChain** → 700+ integrations
- **LlamaIndex** → Stupid easy RAG  
- **Google ADK** → Pay-per-execution
- **Smol AI** → Minimalist approach

---

# MCP Won

<div class="quote">"Everyone has switched to MCP. It is kind of the standard."<br/>- Colin McNamara</div>

## Universal tool integration across everything

---

# AI IDEs Killed Framework Choice

## The Big 3:
- **Cursor** → Most popular (SOC 2 certified)
- **Cline** → Community favorite (1.6M+ installs)  
- **Windsurf** → Dark horse (OpenAI acquisition rumors)

---

# Google's Plot Twist

<div class="big-text">Google endorsed n8n</div>

## Nobody saw that coming

---

# Orchestration Winner

<div class="quote">"LangGraph is the winner"<br/>- Colin McNamara</div>

## Why?
Native Python + built-in observability + A2A ready

---

# The Economics Shift

<div class="quote">"I want to pay for agents when they're executed, especially now that things are moving async."<br/>- Colin McNamara</div>

---

# Async Is Inevitable

<div class="big-text">"Get back to me in 20 minutes. I don't care."</div>

## 20-minute response times are the new normal

---

# Monitor Everything

<div class="quote">"Think of my entire application stack as A through Z. My agents are like LMNOP."<br/>- Colin McNamara</div>

---

# Security Reality Check

<div class="quote">"At some point your AI is going to lose its mind and hack you. How are you gonna know?"</div>

## Build to federal standards

---

# Agent Mesh Future

<div class="quote">"The future of asynchronous development agents collaborating together and orchestrating these complex graphs together."<br/>- Colin McNamara</div>

---

# Your Action Plan

## Start Tomorrow:

1. **🔧 Start anywhere** → Modern tooling makes any framework viable
2. **🔗 Embrace MCP** → Universal integration is here  
3. **💰 Design for async** → Cost optimization architecture

---

# Key Takeaway

<div class="big-text">The infrastructure is being built NOW.</div>

<div class="big-text">Will you be ready?</div>
