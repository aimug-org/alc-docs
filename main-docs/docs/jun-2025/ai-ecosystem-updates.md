### Cost Optimization Strategy

Colin's key insight on modern AI economics:

> "I want to pay for agents when they're executed, especially now that things are moving async. I don't have this huge need for real-time access. Get back to me in 20 minutes. I don't care."

**Implications:**
- **Async-first design**: Build for eventual consistency
- **Pay-per-execution**: Optimize for usage-based pricing
- **Stateless architectures**: Enable true serverless scaling
- **Background processing**: Embrace longer response times for cost savings

## 6. Observability & Monitoring Stack

### The A-Z Application Context

Colin's framework for thinking about observability:

> "Think of my entire application stack as A through Z. My agents are like LMNOP. So within LMNOP, you have your eval frameworks, your tracing and eval frameworks."

### AI-Specific Observability (LMNOP)

#### **LangSmith vs LangFuse**

**LangSmith:**
- **Pros**: Works out of the box, comprehensive features, cloud-hosted version is economical
