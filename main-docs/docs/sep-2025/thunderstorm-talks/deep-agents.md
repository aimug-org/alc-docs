# Deep Agents Architecture

**Speaker:** Collier  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Time:** 7:00 PM - 7:15 PM

## Overview

Dive into advanced agent architectures and learn about building sophisticated multi-agent systems. This talk explores:

- Hierarchical agent structures
- Inter-agent communication protocols
- Distributed agent systems
- Complex reasoning chains

## Key Topics

### Agent Architecture Patterns

- Supervisor-worker models
- Peer-to-peer agent networks
- Specialized agent roles
- Dynamic agent spawning

### Advanced Concepts

- Shared memory systems
- Agent coordination strategies
- Consensus mechanisms
- Fault tolerance and resilience

### Implementation Considerations

- Scalability challenges
- Resource management
- Monitoring and observability
- Security considerations

## Use Cases

- Complex problem solving
- Distributed data processing
- Autonomous decision making
- Real-time system coordination

## Resources
