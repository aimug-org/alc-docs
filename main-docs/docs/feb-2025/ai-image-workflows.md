# AI Image Generation Workflows

Learn about production-grade image generation pipelines demonstrated by Colin and Karim during our February showcase, covering both cloud-based services and local GPU setups.

*This documentation will be updated with presentation transcripts and implementation details from the February 5th showcase.*

## Cloud-Based Pipeline

Colin showcases integration with Replicate's cloud services:

### Key Benefits
- No GPU required - perfect for teams without specialized hardware
- Pay-per-use pricing model
- Access to a variety of pre-trained models
- Automatic scaling for batch processing
- Built-in API management and monitoring

### Production Considerations
- API key management and security
- Cost monitoring and optimization
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Error handling and retry strategies
- Response caching strategies

## Local GPU Pipeline

Karim demonstrates optimizing image generation on consumer hardware:

### Hardware Setup
- RTX 4090 Configuration
- CUDA and PyTorch optimization
- Memory management techniques
- Temperature and power monitoring
- Storage considerations for model weights

### Performance Optimization
- Batch processing strategies
- Memory efficiency techniques
- Pipeline optimization tips
- Model pruning and quantization
- Caching and pre-loading strategies

## Website Integration

How we use these pipelines for the Austin LangChain website:
