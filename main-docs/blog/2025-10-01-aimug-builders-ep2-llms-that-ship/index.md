# AIMUG Builders Ep.2 – LLMs That Actually Ship

In our second episode of **AIMUG Builders**, we sat down with [Jeff Linwood](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jefflinwood/) to dig into how LLMs can actually improve the software development lifecycle—not just generate snippets.

Jeff has 25+ years of development experience and is leading work on **ZapCircle**, a TypeScript + LangChain framework designed for real-world teams. This wasn't a theoretical chat—we went straight into what works, what breaks, and how to bring LLMs into existing systems.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

* **ZapCircle Framework (TS + LangChain)**
  A practical dev framework that makes LangChain fit naturally into TypeScript apps.

* **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with LLM prompts**
  Using LLMs to turn plain-language scenarios into testable behaviors, making teams faster without skipping rigor.

* **Human-in-the-loop Code Review Pipelines**
  Why code review isn't going away—and how to build LLM assistive review flows that keep trust intact.

* **Integration Patterns**
  Hard lessons from trying to plug LLMs into existing stacks—where they accelerate teams, and where they can grind things to a halt.

## Why It Matters

So much LLM content online is toy demos. AIMUG Builders is about **real engineering practices**—things you can put into production tomorrow. If you're building with LangChain, LangGraph, or integrating LLMs into your stack, you'll find signal here.
