# Enterprise AI Insights from the Interrupt Conference: Real-World Deployment Strategies

*June 11, 2025 | Austin LangChain AI Middleware Users Group (AIMUG)*

The Interrupt Conference delivered a treasure trove of enterprise AI insights, and our Austin LangChain community was there to capture the most critical lessons. In a comprehensive panel discussion featuring six of our members who attended the conference, we distilled the practical wisdom from the front lines of AI deployment.

This isn't theoretical—these are battle-tested strategies from organizations like BlackRock, JP Morgan, Harvey, Monday.com, and others who are successfully deploying AI agents at enterprise scale.

## 🎯 The Enterprise Reality Check

The energy at Interrupt was palpable, but beneath the excitement lay a sobering truth: **moving from AI prototypes to production-ready enterprise systems requires fundamentally different approaches**. Our panelists—Colin McNamara, Collier King, Ricky Pirruccio, Karim Lalani, Cam, and Paul—brought back insights that every enterprise AI team needs to hear.

### The Four Pillars of Enterprise AI Success

Through analyzing dozens of presentations and real-world case studies, four critical themes emerged that separate successful enterprise AI deployments from failed experiments.

## 🏗️ Pillar 1: Build a Resilient Foundation - Evaluation and Observability Are Non-Negotiable

### The Evaluation Imperative

**"You need to have evaluations from day one."** This wasn't just advice—it was the drumbeat that echoed throughout Interrupt. Harrison Chase from LangChain emphasized that **quality, not latency or cost, is the number one blocker for getting agents into production**.

This represents a fundamental shift in how we approach AI development. Evaluation isn't an afterthought for mature projects; it's the foundation that enables everything else.

#### The Three-Phase Evaluation Lifecycle

Enterprise-grade AI systems require a sophisticated evaluation approach:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Development Lifecycle] --> B{Offline Evals}
    B -- Pre-Production --> C[Static Datasets & Benchmarking]
    C --> D[Model/Agent Iteration]
    D --> E[Deployment]
    E --> F{Online Evals}
    F -- In-Production --> G[Live Data Monitoring & Scoring]
    G --> H[Performance Tracking]
    E --> I{In-the-Loop Evals}
    I -- Runtime --> J[Agent Action Correction]
    J --> K[Improved Response Quality]
    H --> D
    K --> D
```

**1. Offline Evaluations**: Pre-production testing against static datasets and benchmarks, enabling rapid iteration on model and agent design.

**2. Online Evaluations**: Live production monitoring, scoring performance, and tracking real-world behavior patterns.

**3. In-the-Loop Evaluations**: Real-time course correction during execution—critical for high-stakes applications like financial transactions or long-running agent workflows.

### Enterprise Observability: Beyond Traditional Monitoring

**"Great evals start with great observability."** AI observability is fundamentally different from traditional system monitoring. It's not built for SREs—it's designed for the emerging "Agent Engineer" persona.

#### Key Differences in AI Observability:

- **Multimodal traces**: Large, unstructured data requiring specialized analysis
- **Tool trajectory tracking**: Understanding how agents use tools and make decisions
- **ML-specific metrics**: Beyond latency and throughput to include reasoning quality
- **Context engineering insights**: Visibility into prompt effectiveness and model behavior

#### Enterprise Preferences:

Our panelists noted strong enterprise preference for **self-hosted observability solutions** for:
- **Control and compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements
- **Security**: Keeping sensitive data within organizational boundaries
- **Customization**: Adapting to specific enterprise workflows

### LLM-as-a-Judge: Powerful but Requires Careful Implementation

Using LLMs to evaluate other LLMs offers sophisticated assessment capabilities but demands careful engineering:

```mermaid
graph TD
    L[Agent LLM Output] --> M[LLM-as-a-Judge]
    N[Judge Prompt & Criteria] --> M
    M --> O[Score / Critique]
    O --> P[Eval Calibration & Validation Loop]
    P --> N
```

**Nubank's Success Story**: Their money transfer agent team iterated through six tests, improving their LLM-as-a-Judge F1 score from 51% to 79%—nearly matching human accuracy in just two weeks through careful prompt engineering and model tuning.

## 🤝 Pillar 2: Integrate the Human Element - Trust Through Control and Expertise

### The Trust Barrier

**"Trust, not technology, is the biggest barrier to AI agent adoption."** This insight from Monday.com's Assaf resonated throughout the conference. Technical capability means nothing if users don't trust the system.

#### Building Trust Through Design:

**User Control & Autonomy**: While engineers love fully autonomous agents, users often have different risk appetites. Monday.com found that giving users control over agent autonomy levels dramatically increased adoption.

**Previews Before Actions**: Users froze when agents directly modified production data. Introducing preview functionality before committing changes significantly increased adoption by alleviating concerns about irreversible actions.

**Explainability for Learning**: Users need to understand why an agent produced specific outputs, enabling them to learn how to interact with and guide AI more effectively over time.

### Domain Expertise Integration: The Harvey Model

**Harvey's "Lawyer-on-the-Loop" Approach** demonstrates how to embed domain expertise throughout the development lifecycle:

- **Use case identification**: Lawyers identify complex scenarios requiring AI assistance
- **Evaluation rubric creation**: Domain experts define success criteria
- **UI iteration**: Continuous feedback on user experience
- **End-to-end testing**: Real-world validation with actual practitioners

> "Harvey's strategy involves integrating lawyers at every stage of product development. Their domain expertise and user empathy are considered critical in shaping effective legal AI products." – Ben Lewald (Harvey)

### High-Stakes Human-in-the-Loop: JP Morgan's Approach

**JP Morgan's "AskDavid"** for investment research demonstrates human-AI collaboration in high-stakes environments:

- **Human Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)** provide the "last mile" of accuracy
- **100% AI accuracy may not be feasible** in complex financial domains
- **Human oversight ensures reliability** when billions of dollars are at risk

> "In high-stakes financial applications, where 100% AI accuracy may be unattainable, JP Morgan ensures reliability by incorporating Human Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in the loop." – Jane (JP Morgan)

## 🏢 Pillar 3: Architect for Enterprise Scale - From Prototypes to Production

### Multi-Agent Architecture Evolution

#### 11x's Journey: From Simple to Sophisticated

The 11x team's evolution of their AI SDR "Alice" provides a masterclass in architectural progression:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Supervisor[Supervisor Agent] --> UserInteraction{User Interaction & Task Routing}
    UserInteraction --> Researcher[Researcher Sub-Agent]
    UserInteraction --> PositioningReport[Positioning Report Sub-Agent]
    UserInteraction --> LinkedInWriter[LinkedIn Message Writer Sub-Agent]
    UserInteraction --> EmailWriter[Email Writer Sub-Agent]
    Researcher --> Supervisor
    PositioningReport --> Supervisor
    LinkedInWriter --> Supervisor
    EmailWriter --> Supervisor
```

**Key Learning**: "The multi-agent architecture provided the best of both worlds: the flexibility of a React-based agent combined with the performance characteristics of a structured workflow."

#### Box's Metadata Extraction: Agentic from the Start

Ben Kuss from Box re-architected their metadata extraction from traditional pipelines to multi-agent systems:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Input[Document + Fields to Extract] --> Supervisor{Supervising Agent}
    Supervisor --> PreProcessingAgent[Pre-Processing Sub-Agent]
    PreProcessingAgent -- Handles OCR, Large Docs --> DataGroupingAgent[Data Grouping Sub-Agent]
    DataGroupingAgent -- Groups related fields --> ExtractionAgent[Extraction Sub-Agent]
    ExtractionAgent -- Chooses extraction methods --> QualityFeedbackAgent[Quality Feedback Sub-Agent]
    QualityFeedbackAgent -- Assesses accuracy, triggers retries --> Output[Extracted Data]
    QualityFeedbackAgent -- Feedback --> ExtractionAgent
```

**Key Insight**: "An agentic-based approach offers a cleaner engineering abstraction. For new intelligent features, especially with unstructured data or complex workflows: build agentic, build it early."

### Enterprise-Grade Deployment Patterns

#### BlackRock's Federated Plugin Registry

BlackRock's Aladdin Copilot demonstrates enterprise-scale agent orchestration:

```mermaid
graph TD
    UserQuery["User Query"] --> OrchestrationGraph["Orchestration Graph (LangGraph)"]
    OrchestrationGraph --> InputGuardrail["Input Guardrails Moderation PII"]
    InputGuardrail --> FilteringAccessControl[Filtering & Access Control]
    PluginRegistry[Plugin Registry: Tools & Custom Agents from Domain Teams] --> FilteringAccessControl
    FilteringAccessControl -- Selected Tools and Agents --> OrchestrationNode["Orchestration Node GPT-4 Function Calling"]
    OrchestrationNode <--> PlanningActionLoop[Planning & Action Loop]
    PlanningActionLoop --> OutputGuardrail["Output Guardrails Hallucination Check"]
    OutputGuardrail --> FinalAnswer[Final Answer to User]
```

**Key Features**:
- **Federated approach**: Various engineering teams onboard domain-specific tools
- **Centralized orchestration**: Maintains control while enabling distributed development
- **Evaluation-driven development**: Rigorous testing of each intended behavior

#### JP Morgan's Multi-Agent Investment Research

```mermaid
graph TD
    UserQuery["User Query"] --> Supervisor[Supervisor Agent]
    Supervisor -- Task Delegation --> StructDataAgent["Structured Data Sub-Agent SQL or API"]
    Supervisor -- Task Delegation --> UnstructDataAgent["Unstructured Data Sub-Agent RAG"]
    Supervisor -- Task Delegation --> AnalyticsAgent["Analytics Sub-Agent Proprietary Models"]
    StructDataAgent --> Supervisor
    UnstructDataAgent --> Supervisor
    AnalyticsAgent --> Supervisor
    Supervisor --> Personalize["Personalize Answer by user role"]
    Personalize --> Reflect["Reflection Node LLM Judge for sense check"]
    Reflect -- If Fails --> Supervisor
    Reflect -- If Passes --> Summarize[Summarize & Return Answer]
```

**Development Strategy**: "Start simple and refactor often. Build and validate specialized sub-agents first, then integrate them with a supervisor agent."

### Core Architectural Principles

#### Tools Over Skills
**Equip agents with external tools** rather than building all capabilities internally:
- More modular and maintainable
- Token-efficient, minimizing context usage
- Enables rapid capability expansion

#### Mental Models Matter
The 11x team found that viewing agents as **"human coworkers" or "teams"** led to better architectural decisions than thinking of them as user flows.

#### Bridging the Gaps (Shreya Shankar, UC Berkeley)

```mermaid
graph TD
    Developer --> A{Data Understanding Gap}
    A -- Tooling: Anomaly Detection & Failure Mode Clustering --> B[Understand Data & Failure Modes]
    Developer --> C{Intent Specification Gap}
    C -- Tooling: Interactive Prompt Refinement & Revision History --> D[Clearly Specify Intent]
    B --> E[Design Evals for Failure Modes]
    D --> F[Improve Pipeline: Prompt Engineering, Task Decomposition]
    E --> F
    F --> G[Reliable Data Processing Agent]
```

**Two Critical Gaps**:
1. **Data Understanding Gap**: Knowing what's in your data and its unique failure modes
2. **Intent Specification Gap**: Clearly defining what you really want the agent to do

## 🚀 Pillar 4: Platform Thinking - Building for Scale and Collaboration
