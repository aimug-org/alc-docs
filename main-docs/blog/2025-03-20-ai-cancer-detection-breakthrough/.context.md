# AI Cancer Detection Breakthrough Blog Post

This blog post covers Vinika Kakarla's presentation at the March Austin LangChain meeting, where she demonstrated her innovative approach to using AI/ML for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HTC), a fatal liver cancer. The project has personal significance as this cancer claimed the life of her grandfather.

## Content Overview

The post highlights:
- Vinika's background as a high school sophomore with interest in AI and molecular biology
- The significance of hepatocellular carcinoma as a global health issue
- The role of P53 protein mutations in cancer progression
- Her innovative machine learning model that combines deep neural networks, XGBoost, and graph convolutional networks
- The efficiency gains of her approach compared to traditional methods
- Future directions for the project
