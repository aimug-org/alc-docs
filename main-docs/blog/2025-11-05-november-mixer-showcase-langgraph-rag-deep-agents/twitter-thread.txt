Our Nov 5 Mixer brought 50+ builders for real talk on LangGraph, RAG failures & $80 deep agent pipelines. No marketing fluff—just production lessons. 🧵

@colinmcnamara kicked off with LangGraph fundamentals: controllability, state persistence, human-in-the-loop. Running 5 production apps including FDA compliance where "people can die if you screw up."

@anupama_garani (PIMCO) dropped the stats: 42% of enterprise AI failed in 2025. 51% of those? RAG implementations. Only 200/1000 companies succeeded.

The goldfish vs elephant memory problem is real.

TWEET 4:
5 pillars of RAG failure:
• Strategy failures
• Data quality issues
• Prompt engineering gaps
• Evaluation blind spots
• Governance catastrophes

State = Context + Memory + orchestration layer

TWEET 5:
@CollierKing (Cloudflare) ran an $80, 3.5hr deep agent pipeline analyzing Jensen's keynote → 400 companies → 244 pages.

11M tokens. 87/100 companies ranked.

"LLMs are fine-tuned to save tokens. They'll take shortcuts."

TWEET 6:
Middleware is critical for agent control:
• Validation tracking
• Logging for 3.5hr runs
• Before/after tool hooks
• "Like having a toddler—let it fall, give error messages, watch it course correct"

Paul Phelps from AIMUG Panama: "95% of AI pilots fail—not the model, but organizational approach. PMs still use legacy SaaS mental models."

AI is non-deterministic. Requirements evolve. Scope changes = signals it works.

TWEET 8:
Decision matrix:
LangGraph → deterministic, compliance, cost efficiency
Deep Agents → research, planning, large context

State matters: Context (now) + Memory (history) + State (orchestration)
