## 🎤 The Talks

### Colin McNamara: Introduction to LangGraph

Colin (Always Cool Brands) walked us through LangGraph fundamentals using community training materials from the LangChain team.

**Key Points:**
- Controllability through graph structures (nodes, edges, state)
- State persistence in Postgres/Redis for long-running processes
- Running 5 production apps including FDA compliance
- Human-in-the-loop native support

> "People can die if you screw up, right? And I'm legally liable as an officer in the company... I want to make sure that it does every step every time and I want to make sure that's logged."

**When to use:** Compliance requirements, repeatability, cost efficiency

### Anupama Garani: Why RAG Use Cases Crash and Burn

Anupama (PIMCO Data Specialist) shared hard truths from her team's Microsoft-featured RAG success story.

**The Numbers:**
- 42% of enterprise AI use cases failed in 2025
- 51% of failures were RAG implementations
- Only 200 out of 1,000 companies successfully deployed RAG (S&P Global)

**The Problem:** Most chatbots have "goldfish memory"—they forget context between conversations.

**The Solution:** LangGraph enables "elephant memory" through state persistence.

**State Architecture:**
- Context = current conversation
- Memory = conversation history
- State = orchestration layer that persists both

### Collier King: Deep Agents in Production

Collier (Cloudflare ML Engineer) shared unvarnished experience running an $80, 3.5-hour deep agent pipeline.

**The Pipeline:**
Analyze Jensen Huang's GTC keynote → Extract themes → Match 400 companies → Validate with press releases → Rank top 100

**Performance:**
- Runtime: 3.5 hours
- Tokens: 11 million
- Cost: $80
- Output: 244 pages
- Success: 87/100 companies ranked

**Critical Learning:** Middleware is essential for control.

> "These LLMs are fine-tuned to save tokens. They will just naturally take shortcuts. Even the good ones like Google Gemini or Claude, they'll do this. You have to be very explicit."

**Middleware Solutions:**
- Validation tracking (before/after tool hooks)
- Logging for debugging long runs
- Error feedback for self-correction

### Paul Phelps: AI Project Management Anti-Patterns

Paul (freelance AI consultant) presented remotely from AIMUG Panama (100 members!) on why 95% of AI projects fail.

**The Problem:**
> "The constraint for AI getting into production is not the model, but the organizational approach. Product/Project Managers still use legacy SaaS/ERP mental models."

**AI Reality vs Traditional Software:**
- Traditional: Predictable, complete requirements upfront, same input = same output
- AI: Non-deterministic, requirements evolve, scope changes = system working

**Red Flags:**
- PMs demanding complete requirements before code
- No developer involvement in requirements
- Treating AI like traditional software delivery

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

### Decision Matrix: LangGraph vs Deep Agents

**Use LangGraph when:**
- Deterministic workflows required
- Compliance/safety requirements
- Cost efficiency critical
- Repeatability needed

**Use Deep Agents when:**
- Open-ended research tasks
- Complex multi-step planning
- Managing large context
- Long-term memory required

### Enterprise AI Success Factors

1. Developer involvement from day one
2. Accept non-deterministic behavior
3. Iterative discovery vs complete upfront requirements
4. Cross-functional collaboration
5. Golden datasets for evaluation
6. User feedback loops
7. Audit trails for compliance
