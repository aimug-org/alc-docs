## Email Body

Hi AIMUG Community!

What an incredible October showcase! With 60+ attendees and presentations ranging from production middleware patterns to groundbreaking medical research, our community continues to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI agents.

### üìö **Four Cutting-Edge Presentations**

#### üîß LangGraph 1.0 Alpha & Middleware (Colin McNamara)

LangGraph is moving to stable 1.0 releases with a powerful new middleware architecture. Three hooks give you unprecedented control over your agents:

- **before_model**: Context management, token limits, guardrails
- **model**: Dynamic model swapping, caching, tool control
- **after_model**: Human-in-the-loop, circuit breakers, validation

**Real-world impact:** Colin shared his production FinOps use case processing EDI orders with human approval for capacity-exceeding transactions.

**Companies using it:** JPMorgan Chase, NuvoBank, LinkedIn

#### ü§ù A2A/AP2: The Future of Agent Commerce (Ryan Booth)

Google's Agent-to-Agent protocol and OpenAI's Agent Payment Protocol are here, enabling:

- **Agent discovery**: Like SEO, but for AI agents finding services
- **Capability negotiation**: Automated contract discussions
- **Payment processing**: Transactions within chat interfaces

Ryan demonstrated his Corvara marketplace where agents bid on software projects, negotiate contracts, and complete work autonomously.

**Key insight:** Businesses must now optimize for "Agent Engine Optimization" (AEO) to remain discoverable in an AI-first world.

#### üß¨ AI Cancer Detection Research (Venika Kakarla)

Our mentored high school student shared her Stanford internship research on hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer):

- **Dataset:** 1.4 million cells across 124+ tumor regions
- **Methods:** Spatial analysis, Voronoi tessellation clustering, MVD analysis
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy
- **Future:** Graph Attention Networks for recurrence prediction

From reducing 2,500 hours of compute to 5 minutes in Google Colab to presenting at Stanford's School of Medicine - Venika's journey exemplifies the democratizing power of AI tools.

#### ‚ö° LLM Inference Provider Comparison (Dmitri Iourovitski)

Dmitri provided a practical guide to choosing local LLM inference providers:

**Ollama/Llama.cpp:** Best for quick demos and macOS development
- ‚úÖ Easy setup, no GPU required
- ‚ùå No batching, opaque memory management

**Hugging Face Transformers:** Best for flexibility and latest models
- ‚úÖ Day-one model access, Flash Attention since 2023
- ‚ùå Steep learning curve

**VLLM:** Best for production scale
- ‚úÖ Paged attention, automatic batching
- ‚ùå Requires high-end GPUs (12GB+ VRAM)

**Performance benchmark:** 35 minutes (Ollama) ‚Üí 8 minutes (Transformers) for same OCR task!
