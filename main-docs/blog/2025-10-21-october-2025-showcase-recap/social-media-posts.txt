## Twitter/X Post 2 (LangGraph Focus)

LangGraph 1.0 is HERE! 🚀

New middleware architecture gives you control at 3 critical points:
✅ before_model - Context & guardrails
✅ model - Swapping & caching
✅ after_model - HITL & validation

JPMorgan, NuvoBank & LinkedIn already in production.

## Twitter/X Post 3 (A2A/AP2)

The future of AI commerce is here 🤖💰

Agent-to-Agent (A2A) + Agent Payment Protocol (AP2) = automated service marketplaces

Agents can now:
🔍 Discover services
💼 Negotiate contracts
💵 Complete transactions

Live demo included!

## October AIMUG Showcase: Enterprise AI Agent Architectures

Our October monthly showcase brought together 60+ AI practitioners to explore production-ready agent architectures and emerging protocols.

**Key Presentations:**

🔧 **LangGraph 1.0 Middleware** - Colin McNamara demonstrated the new three-hook architecture enabling enterprise deployments at JPMorgan Chase, NuvoBank, and LinkedIn. Real-world use case: FinOps automation with human-in-the-loop approval workflows.

🤝 **A2A/AP2 Protocols** - Ryan Booth explored Google's Agent-to-Agent protocol and OpenAI's Agent Payment Protocol, showcasing a live marketplace where agents discover services, negotiate contracts, and process payments.

🧬 **AI Cancer Detection** - High school student Venika Kakarla presented Stanford research on hepatocellular carcinoma using spatial analysis and Graph Attention Networks across 1.4M cells.

⚡ **LLM Inference Optimization** - Dmitri Iourovitski compared Ollama, Hugging Face Transformers, and VLLM with production benchmarks and deployment guidance.

**Impact:**
- Production patterns for agent middleware
- Agent marketplace economics emerging
- AI democratization in medical research
- 77% performance improvement with proper inference setup

## Reddit Post (r/MachineLearning, r/LangChain, r/Austin)

**Title:** October AIMUG Showcase: LangGraph 1.0 Middleware, A2A/AP2 Protocols, and AI Cancer Research [Discussion]

Hey everyone!

Just wanted to share highlights from our Austin LangChain AI Middleware User Group (AIMUG) October showcase. We had 60+ attendees exploring some really exciting developments in agent architectures.

**Four main presentations:**

1. **LangGraph 1.0 Middleware** - New three-hook architecture (before_model, model, after_model) that makes production agent deployment significantly easier. Real production use case in FinOps with human-in-the-loop workflows.

2. **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) & Agent Payment Protocol (AP2)** - Google's A2A protocol + OpenAI's AP2 for agent discovery and transactions. Live demo of an agent marketplace for software development services.

3. **AI Cancer Detection** - Stanford research on hepatocellular carcinoma using spatial analysis and Graph Attention Networks. High school student analyzing 1.4M cells - pretty inspiring!

4. **LLM Inference Providers** - Practical comparison of Ollama, Hugging Face Transformers, and VLLM with real benchmarks (35min → 8min optimization on same hardware).
