- **Risk**: Potential unavailability of law firm space for SXSW event
- **Mitigation**: Active identification of backup venues and maintaining flexible scheduling options

**2. Technical Integration Challenges**
- **Risk**: DeepSeek API stability issues and tool calling limitations
- **Mitigation**: Implementation of robust fallback options and maintenance of multi-model support

**3. Resource Allocation**
- **Risk**: Limited volunteer availability for event staffing
- **Mitigation**: Early recruitment initiatives and clear role definitions

### Medium Priority Considerations

**1. Content Management**
- **Risk**: Scaling challenges in multi-channel content production
- **Mitigation**: Implementation of automated workflows and structured editorial processes

**2. Partner Coordination**
