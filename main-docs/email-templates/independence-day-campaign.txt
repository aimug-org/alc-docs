🇺🇸 Only 25 Founding Member Spots Left - Help Make Austin AIMUG Independent

⏰ URGENT: July 4th deadline approaching - Final 25 founding member spots available

Austin's AI Community Needs You
================================

Hi there,

We've built something incredible together over the past 18 months, but we need your help to make it truly independent.

🚀 Our Proven Impact: Learning AI in the Open

LangChain and LangGraph open source projects have been our foundation - the thread tying together so many great projects that have accelerated skills across Austin's AI community and beyond.

- 1,281 members rapidly advancing AI skills together
- 40+ events featuring hands-on LangChain/LangGraph implementations
- Skills acceleration from RAG systems to agent architectures
- Real-world project successes using open source frameworks
- Community impact extending beyond Austin to influence broader AI ecosystem
- Grateful partnerships with Always Cool AI, LangChain AI, CGCS

We're thankful for the partnerships and support that have gotten us here, and we're excited to develop them further as a sustainable, member-supported, corporate underwritten organization.

⚠️ The Problem: Uncertain Future
Without a member foundation, we remain dependent on uncertain funding cycles. Corporate budgets get cut, priorities change, and Austin's AI leadership becomes fragile.

We can't let our community's future depend on uncertain corporate decisions.

The PBS Model: Independence Through Community
============================================

Just like PBS, we're building a sustainable foundation with member support + corporate underwriting. This means:

✅ Guaranteed monthly events regardless of corporate changes
✅ Keep Austin's AI leadership local and independent  
✅ Long-term educational programming
✅ Sustainable community growth

Keep Austin's AI Leadership Local

The choice is ours: Continue depending on uncertain funding cycles, or build something sustainable and independent.
