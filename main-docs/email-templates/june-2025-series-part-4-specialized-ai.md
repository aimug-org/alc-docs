# Hey {{ subscriber.metadata.first_name | default: "friend" }}! 👋

You know how we always joke about "move fast and break things" in tech? 

Well, I just learned about AI being used in nuclear power plants, and let me tell you - when breaking things could literally melt down a reactor, the whole game changes.

## 🤯 When the stakes are REALLY high

So Rob Whelan from Gridway AI came to our June meetup and completely blew my mind. This guy is building AI systems for the nuclear industry, where a mistake isn't just a bug report - it's potentially catastrophic.

The stuff Rob shared about fine-tuning embeddings for nuclear regulatory documents? It's like a masterclass in "how to do AI when you absolutely cannot afford to be wrong."

## 🎯 What "high-stakes AI" actually looks like

Here's what I learned about building AI when failure isn't an option:

**1. Domain expertise isn't optional**
Rob didn't just throw GPT-4 at nuclear documents and hope for the best. He spent months understanding nuclear regulatory language, working with domain experts, and building specialized embeddings that actually understand the nuances.

**2. Testing is everything (and I mean EVERYTHING)**
We're talking about test suites that would make your typical software QA team weep. Every edge case, every possible failure mode, every regulatory requirement - all tested.

**3. Explainability is a requirement, not a nice-to-have**
When a nuclear engineer asks "why did the AI recommend this?" the answer can't be "the model said so." You need to be able to trace every decision back to specific regulatory documents and reasoning.

**4. The models are smaller, but way more precise**
Forget about using the biggest, flashiest model. Rob's using specialized embeddings that are laser-focused on nuclear terminology. Sometimes smaller and specialized beats bigger and general.

## 💡 What this means for the rest of us

**If you're building AI for any regulated industry:**
Healthcare, finance, aviation - the patterns Rob shared apply everywhere that mistakes have serious consequences.

**If you're just building regular business apps:**
The discipline and rigor from high-stakes AI can make your "regular" AI way better. Why not build evaluation and explainability from the start?

**If you're curious about specialized AI:**
This is where the really interesting work is happening. General AI is cool, but specialized AI that actually understands domain-specific knowledge? That's where the magic happens.

## 🚀 Practical lessons you can steal

**1. Start with domain experts**
Don't build AI for a domain you don't understand. Find the experts, listen to them, learn from them.

**2. Build evaluation that matters**
Don't just measure accuracy - measure the things that actually matter in your domain.

**3. Make your AI explainable**
Even if you're not in a regulated industry, being able to explain your AI's decisions builds trust.

**4. Consider specialized models**
Sometimes a smaller, domain-specific model beats a general-purpose giant.

## 🔗 What's coming next in this series

This is Part 4 of our June 2025 deep dive. One more to go:

- **Part 5**: The complete 2025 AI ecosystem landscape (spoiler: it's way bigger and more interconnected than most people realize)

## 💬 Real talk from the nuclear AI trenches

> "When you're dealing with nuclear safety documents, 'good enough' isn't in the vocabulary. Every embedding, every similarity score, every recommendation has to be traceable back to specific regulatory requirements."
> 
> **— Rob Whelan, who's actually doing this stuff at Gridway AI**

> "The discipline required for nuclear AI makes everything else feel easy. If you can build AI that meets nuclear safety standards, you can build AI for anything."
> 
> **— Colin McNamara, after learning way more about nuclear regulations than expected**
