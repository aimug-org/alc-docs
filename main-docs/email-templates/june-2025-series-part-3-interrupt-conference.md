# Hey {{ subscriber.metadata.first_name | default: "friend" }}! ðŸ‘‹

So a few of us from the Austin community just got back from the Interrupt Conference, and wow... I need to tell you what we learned because it's kind of a big deal.

The short version? Enterprise AI isn't just "coming" anymore - it's here, it's working, and companies are making serious money with it.

## ðŸ¤¯ The reality check we all needed

Look, I'll be honest - sometimes our Austin meetups can feel a bit like we're playing with cool toys. But after talking to folks who are deploying AI systems that handle millions of dollars in decisions every day? 

This stuff is getting REAL real.

### [Interrupt Conference Enterprise Insights: What We Learned About Production AI](https://aimug.org/blog/2025-06-11-interrupt-conference-enterprise-insights-series-part-3/)
*Published on June 11, 2025 by Colin McNamara, Collier King, Cameron Rohn, Paul Phelps, Ricky Pirruccio, and Karim Lalani*

We had a whole crew there - Collier, Cameron, Paul, Ricky, Karim and myself - and we came back with some pretty mind-blowing insights.

## ðŸŽ¯ The stuff that actually matters in production

Here's what we learned from companies that are actually making this work:

**1. Evaluation is everything**
Remember how we always talk about "how do you know if your AI is working?" Well, turns out the companies that are succeeding have figured this out. They're not just hoping their AI works - they're measuring it constantly.

**2. Human-in-the-loop isn't optional**
Every successful enterprise AI system we heard about has humans involved. Not because the AI isn't good enough, but because that's how you build trust and handle edge cases.

**3. Observability is the new monitoring**
You know how we monitor servers and databases? Same thing is happening with AI systems now. Companies are tracking everything - model performance, user satisfaction, business impact.

**4. The tooling is finally catching up**
This was the big surprise - the enterprise tooling around AI is actually getting really good. LangSmith, Weights & Biases, custom observability platforms... it's not just research tools anymore.

## ðŸ’¡ What this means for us in Austin

**If you're just getting started:**
Focus on the fundamentals - evaluation, testing, and understanding how to measure success. The companies that are winning aren't necessarily using the fanciest models.

**If you're building for work:**
Start thinking about observability from day one. How will you know if your system is working? How will you debug it when it's not?

**If you're already deep in this:**
The patterns we're seeing in enterprise are probably coming to smaller companies soon. Get ahead of the curve.

## ðŸš€ Practical takeaways you can use right now

**1. Start measuring everything**
Even if you're just experimenting, get in the habit of tracking what works and what doesn't. Future you will thank present you.

**2. Build evaluation into your workflow**
Don't just build and hope. Create test cases, measure performance, understand your failure modes.

**3. Think about the human experience**
The best AI systems make humans more effective, not replace them. Design for collaboration, not automation.

**4. Plan for production from the start**
Even if you're just prototyping, think about how you'd monitor and maintain this in production.

## ðŸ”— What's coming next in this series

This is Part 3 of our June 2025 deep dive. Still coming this week:

- **Part 4**: AI in nuclear power and other high-stakes industries (spoiler: the stakes are REALLY high)
- **Part 5**: The complete 2025 AI ecosystem landscape (it's bigger than you think)

## ðŸ’¬ Real talk from the conference crew

> "The gap between what we're doing in our meetups and what enterprises are doing isn't as big as I thought. We're actually pretty well positioned to understand this stuff."
> 
> **â€” Collier King, after three days of enterprise AI talks**

> "The observability piece was the biggest eye-opener for me. These companies are treating AI systems like any other critical infrastructure."
> 
> **â€” Paul Phelps, who's been thinking about this a lot**

## ðŸ“… Let's talk about this stuff

- **Community Call**: Thursday at 2 PM Central - We'll definitely be talking about enterprise patterns
- **Office Hours**: Tuesday at 2 PM Central - Bring your production questions
- **Monthly Meetup**: First Wednesday - Maybe we should do an enterprise-focused session?
