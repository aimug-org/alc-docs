## Implementation Details

The email templates use a hybrid of Markdown and HTML formatting to ensure compatibility with various email clients. All templates include:

1. A standardized header with the Austin LangChain logo
2. Personalization using Buttondown templating variables 
3. Social media links in the footer
4. Unsubscribe link and legal information
5. Implementation notes for editors

## Email Sequence Overview

The drip campaign consists of four strategic emails sent over a two-week period:

1. **Welcome & Introduction** - Immediately after subscription
2. **Learning Resources** - 3 days after Email 1
3. **Community Engagement** - 5 days after Email 2
4. **Recent Showcase & Invitation** - 7 days after Email 3

## Weekly RSS Digest Emails

The weekly RSS digest emails are designed to be sent every Sunday, pulling in content from the community's RSS feed:

1. **Comprehensive Weekly Digest** - A full-featured digest with categorized content, community spotlight, archives, and personalized recommendations
2. **Simple Weekly Digest** - A streamlined version focusing on essential content for special editions or when a simpler format is desired

These templates leverage Buttondown's RSS feed integration capabilities and use template variables to dynamically populate content from the feed.

## Usage Guidelines

- All URLs should be fully qualified (https://) to ensure they work in email clients
- Images should be hosted on the aimug.org domain for reliability
- Test all emails before sending by previewing in multiple email clients
- Verify all links are working before sending
