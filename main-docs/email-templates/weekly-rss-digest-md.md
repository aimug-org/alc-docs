## Notes for Implementation

- This template uses Buttondown's RSS feed variables to create a comprehensive weekly digest
- The template is designed to be sent every Sunday, pulling in the latest content from your RSS feed
- Replace placeholder URLs with actual URLs for your community
- Test the email by sending yourself a preview before deploying to all subscribers
- The template includes conditional content based on viewing medium (email vs. web) and subscriber metadata
- Some sections use Liquid template syntax that may need adjustment based on your specific RSS feed structure
