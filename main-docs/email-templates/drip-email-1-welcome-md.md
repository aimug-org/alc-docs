## Who We Are

Austin LangChain is a community dedicated to exploring artificial intelligence through the lens of LangChain and related middleware technologies. Since October 2023, we've been documenting our collective learning journey through monthly meetings, hands-on labs, and community showcases.

We believe that AI development should be:
- **Collaborative:** Learning from each other's experiences
- **Transparent:** Sharing both successes and challenges
- **Accessible:** Making AI development approachable for everyone
- **Practical:** Building real-world applications together
