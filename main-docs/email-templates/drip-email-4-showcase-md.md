### High School Sophomore Creates Groundbreaking AI Solution for Detecting Fatal Liver Cancer

At our March meeting, Venika Kakarla, a sophomore from Round Rock High School, presented her extraordinary machine learning model for analyzing hepatocellular carcinomaâ€”the liver cancer that claimed her grandfather's life.

Her innovative multi-algorithm approach combines:
- Deep Neural Networks for stability classification
- XGBoost Regression for numerical thermostability prediction
- Graph Convolutional Networks for DNA binding affinity analysis

Most impressively, her model completes analyses in just 3 minutes that traditionally require 2,500 hours of computational time.

This remarkable project exemplifies the spirit of our community:
- Real-world impact through AI
- Accessibility of advanced technology to all ages
- Supporting innovation from newcomers
- Sharing knowledge to inspire others
