## Who We Are

Austin LangChain is a community dedicated to exploring artificial intelligence through the lens of LangChain and related middleware technologies. Since October 2023, we've been documenting our collective learning journey through monthly meetings, hands-on labs, and community showcases.

We believe that AI development should be:
- **Collaborative:** Learning from each other's experiences
- **Transparent:** Sharing both successes and challenges
- **Accessible:** Making AI development approachable for everyone
- **Practical:** Building real-world applications together

## What is LangChain?

LangChain is more than just a framework - it's a bridge that connects various AI technologies, making them accessible and practical. Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for AI development, bringing together:

- Large Language Models (like GPT-4, Claude, and local models)
- Vector Databases
- Document Processing
- Memory Systems
- And much more!

Through these integrations, our community explores the entire AI ecosystem while building practical applications.
