# Independence Day Support Popup Implementation Plan

## 📋 Project Overview

**Goal:** Replace the existing newsletter popup with an Independence Day-themed support popup to drive founding member signups and donations before July 4th, 2025.

**Strategy:** Option 1 - Complete replacement of newsletter popup with Independence Day focus until July 4th, then transition back.

**Timeline:** 16 days remaining until July 4th, 2025

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### Core Objectives
1. **Primary Goal:** Drive founding member signups toward 25-member target
2. **Secondary Goal:** Increase quick donations ($5, $15, $25)
3. **Urgency Factor:** Leverage Independence Day deadline for time-sensitive messaging
4. **User Experience:** Maintain clean, focused popup experience without decision paralysis

### Strategic Reasoning
- **Time-Critical Focus:** Only 16 days remaining requires laser focus on primary goal
- **Higher Conversion Potential:** Dedicated messaging performs better than hybrid approaches
- **Cleaner UX:** Single clear message vs competing CTAs reduces cognitive load
- **Natural Transition:** Success creates momentum for future newsletter growth
