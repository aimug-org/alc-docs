# Austin LangChain Documentation Codebase

## Overview

This repository contains the documentation website for the Austin LangChain AI/ML User Group. It serves as a central resource for tutorials, labs, and community information.

## Architecture

The project uses Docusaurus for documentation, organized with the following structure:

- `/main-docs/docs/` - Main documentation content
  - Monthly directories (e.g., `nov-2024/`, `dec-2024/`)
  - Each month contains specific tutorials and labs
- `/main-docs/blog/` - Event announcements and updates
- `/main-docs/src/` - Website source code and components
- `/main-docs/static/` - Static assets and images

## Development Guidelines

### Documentation Structure

   - Include `index.md` for monthly overview
   - Add specific lab files with descriptive names

2. Content Standards
   - Clear prerequisites section
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Working code examples
   - Screenshots or diagrams where helpful

### Website Components

1. React Components
   - Located in `/src/components/`
   - Follow React best practices
   - Maintain consistent styling

2. Static Assets
