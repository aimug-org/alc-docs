# Austin LangChain Documentation Project

## Overview
This repository contains the documentation and event management system for the Austin LangChain AI Middleware User Group. It uses Docusaurus for documentation hosting and includes Python scripts for automated event page management.

## Architecture

### Documentation Structure
- `/main-docs/docs/`: Main documentation content
  - `/{month}-{year}/`: Monthly content directories
  - Each month contains lab materials and guides
- `/main-docs/blog/`: Announcements and blog posts
- `/main-docs/src/pages/`: Static pages including events and community info

### Blog Posts Structure
- `/main-docs/blog/tags.yml`: Defines all available tags
- `/main-docs/blog/authors.yml`: Author profiles and information
- Blog posts should include:
  - Proper frontmatter (slug, title, authors, tags)
  - Truncation marker after first paragraph
  - Only use tags defined in tags.yml
  - Author names linked to GitHub profiles

### Author Profiles
- Set `page: false` unless a dedicated profile page exists
- Include relevant social media links in socials section
- Maintain consistent profile structure and formatting
- Link author names to GitHub profiles in blog posts

### Event Management
- `update_events.py`: Script for managing event information
- `meetup_events.txt`: Raw event data
- `meetup_events_detailed.txt`: Detailed event information

## Development Guidelines

### Environment Setup
1. Install Node.js version 20 or higher
2. Use npm for package management
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Keep dependencies up to date with stable versions

### Documentation
1. All content should be written in Markdown
2. Use front matter for metadata when needed
3. Include code examples where applicable
4. Maintain consistent formatting

### Blog Posts
1. Add truncation marker <!-- truncate --> after first paragraph
2. Only use tags defined in tags.yml
3. Link author names to their GitHub profiles
4. Include all required frontmatter
5. Follow consistent formatting

### Event Management
1. Use the update_events.py script for event page updates
2. Keep event information current
3. Follow the established event page structure

### Code Quality
1. Python scripts should include docstrings
2. React components should be properly typed
3. CSS should use modules to avoid conflicts

## Business Requirements

### Documentation
- Must be easily accessible and searchable
- Should support both beginner and advanced users
- Must include practical examples and use cases

### Event Management
- Must maintain accurate event listings
- Should support both upcoming and past events
- Must include all necessary event details

### Community Support
- Must provide clear contribution guidelines
- Should facilitate community engagement
- Must maintain up-to-date community resources

## Quality Assurance

### Testing
1. Test documentation builds locally before deployment
2. Verify all links are working
3. Ensure event information is accurate
4. Check blog posts for proper tags and truncation

### Review Process
1. Documentation changes require peer review
2. Event updates should be verified for accuracy
3. Code changes must pass linting and tests
4. Verify blog posts follow all guidelines

## Deployment

### Documentation Site
1. Built using Docusaurus
2. Deployed through GitHub Pages
3. Automated builds on main branch updates
4. Requires Node.js 20+ for builds

### Event Updates
1. Run update_events.py to refresh event page
2. Verify changes locally
3. Deploy with documentation updates

## Additional Notes

### Security Considerations
- No sensitive information in documentation
- API keys and credentials must be properly secured
- Follow security best practices for web content

### Performance
- Optimize images and media content
- Minimize build times
- Ensure fast page load times

### Accessibility
- Follow web accessibility guidelines
- Provide alt text for images
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy
