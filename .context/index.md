## Main Technologies

- Docusaurus (React-based documentation framework)
- Markdown for content
- Python scripts for automation (event management, etc.)

## Development Guidelines

- Blog posts should include a truncation marker (`<!-- truncate -->`) after the introduction
- All content should be organized according to the conventions in `.context.md`
- For new blog posts, create a `.context.md` file to document purpose and related content
- Check tags against the defined tags in `/main-docs/blog/tags.yml`
